    "lyrics": "On my pillow\nCan't get me tired\nSharing my fragile truth\nThat I still hope the door is open\n'Cause the window opened one time with you and me\nNow my forever's falling down\nWondering if you'd want me now?\nHow could I know?\nOne day I'd wake up feeling more\nBut I had already reached the shore\nGuess we were ships in the night\nNight, night\nWe were ships in the night\nNight, night\nI'm wondering are you my best friend\nFeel's like a river's rushing through my mind\nI wanna ask you if this is all just in my head\nMy heart is pounding tonight\nI wonder\nIf you\nAre too good to be true?\nAnd would it be alright if I\nPulled you closer\nHow could I know?\nOne day, I'd wake up feeling more\nBut I had already reached the shore\nGuess we were ships in the night\nNight, night\nWe were ships in the night\nNight, night",
